| 11/16 |  2:30-3:00pm  | I spent this time discussing pseudocode with my friends. We decided we could create a file header which could indicate the number of consecutive repeat numbers of bits, as well as the max # of bits needed to represent the highest # of bits, maxBits. Then you can write out each # of consec repeats of bits, alternating between 0 and 1 each time, and representing it through 'maxBits.' |

I am now switching my approach to encoding a map of each "consecutive length" number in the file header, and then representing each of those indices in binary. I am now working on coding that. |

I am using a log function to determine the max number of bits needed to represent a given size of numbers to save space. |
